# The chisq_test function in the coin package can be used to conduct a test of 
# association for a contingency table with one ordered nominal variable and 
# one non-ordered nominal variable.  
# The Cochranâ€“Armitage test is a special case of this where the 
# non-ordered variable has only two categories.
# The scores option is used to indicate which variable should be treated as 
# ordered, and the spacing of the levels of this variable.
