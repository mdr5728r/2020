# MDR5728 – 2020

This is the GitHub repository with teaching materials for the course  **MDR5728 - Bioestatística em R para Métodos Diagnósticos em Medicina** as offered in 2020, aka "Biostatistics in R - 2020", by José de Oliveira Siqueira, Koichi Sameshima and Paulo Sérgio Panse Silveira to the Graduate Program in Medicine, at the School of Medicine -- Universidade de São Paulo.

Basically this course will be based on the content of **Sardanelli F, Di Leo G (2009) Biostatistics for Radiologists: Planning, Performing, and Writing a Radiologic Study. Italy: Springer-Verlag.** We plan to adapt the content of 10 chapters of this book. When necessary other bibliographical sources and examples will be used. 

We will use R language for the applications of the concepts and we expect that each course attendee has a computer with access to the Internet and install following programs: R, RStudio, and Jupyter Notebook.

The instructions for installing R, RStudio  and Jupyter Notebook+Lab is provided in this [link](How_to_install_programs.md).
